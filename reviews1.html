									This month I had a bit of a hard time deciding which high-end liquid blush I should try, you know, cause
									they cost a lot, I had to choose only one. I've been eye-ing on the NARS blush but heck I would hate myself if
									I
									actually spent Rp500k on a blush :) So, I got the Glossier Cloud Paint blush in the colour "Beam", a gorgeous
									coral pink. I could only compare this to the Emina liquid cheek tint,
									which I got from my lovely friend, Sasa. In this case, I have to say that the price does not lie, people. When
									I tried the Emina blush,
									it made my foundation move around and in the end, my cheeks look patchy and I had to reapply some concealers.
									On the other hand,
									the Glossier cloud paint really blends so seamlessly and gives enough pigment for me. One trick I learned
									(from my self haha), that it's
									easier to smear some on your cheeks and then blend them out with a damp beauty blender/sponge. For this
									product, I'd give it a 5/5!
									I'd try the shade Puff next time!

									Behold, the local product everyone and their mothers have been raving about lately, the Pixy Glow BB Cushion. I got this from an online store on instagram,
									and I have a few words to say about this. Coverage? Medium to full. Color? Matches me 100%. Endurance? Not so much. Will I still use it? Of course bitch I bOUGHT IT LOL.
									To be fair, this is the first cushion-type complexion product I've ever had in my life. I've always been a foundation kind of girl, but lately, I felt like
									my skin is so tired of the heaviness of foundation so I decided to buy the Pixy Glow Cushion. Ok, serious review time. I've tried this product on different days, nights, and in different ways.
									I have a combination-oily skin type, and I find that I cannot wear this by itself without powder. When I tried it without a lot of powder, the coverage just separated by itself after only 5 hours.
									But, I didn't give up, I then tried it with full powder, bronzer, blush, and highlighter, & setting spray. DIDNT WORK EITHER! I believe it cannot work well under too much products buildup like that. So, I
									tried a different approach. I put on a tiny moisturizer, the cushion, lots of powder, and a cute pair of blushed cheeks. And suddenly, i found the perfect way for me.
									This product (for me), cannot work well under a lot of products, cannot stand alone without powder, and it budges around easily when I was wearing my glasses. 
									Conclusion, I give this one a 3/5. Still works under specific method and circumstances, but I would like to try another cushion that works better for me :)
